# pbwire C# binding

`bindings/csharp/Pbwire` is the C# binding: `DllImport` over the C ABI in
[`include/pbwire.h`](../../include/pbwire.h), with a `DllImportResolver` that
loads `PBWIRE_LIB` (else `build/libpbwire.{dylib,so}` found above the working
directory). A `FileDescriptorSet` (`protoc --descriptor_set_out`) becomes the
schema at run time; there is no generated code and no C glue. The wire format
lives in the C core, so a C# message and a C message are the same bytes by
construction.

```csharp
using Pbwire;

using var schema = Schema.FromFile("tests/data/matrix3.desc");
var ty = schema.Message("structtest.Scalars3");
var innerTy = schema.Message("structtest.Inner3");

using var msg = ty.NewMessage()
    .Set("i32", -42L)
    .Set("str", "alice");
foreach (var tag in new[] { "a", "bb" })
{
    msg.Set("tags", tag);                       // repeated: appends
}
msg.SetMessage("inner")                         // nested: created in place
   .Set(innerTy.Field("name"), "kid")
   .Set(innerTy.Field("value"), 42L);

var wire = msg.Encode();
using var decoded = ty.Decode(wire);            // unknown fields preserved
if (!decoded.Encode().SequenceEqual(wire))
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException("round trip differs");
}
```

Fields are addressed by name (`"i32"`) or by a `Field` handle from
`ty.Field("i32")`; the handle skips the name lookup and is what a hot loop should
reuse.

## Requirements

The .NET SDK 8+ (built and tested with 10), `make shared`, and nothing else: the
binding project has no package references. `PBWIRE_LIB` overrides the library
path.

## Build and run

```shell
dotnet run --project tests -- ../c/tests/data/matrix3.desc      # self-check
dotnet run --project examples -- ../c/tests/data/matrix3.desc   # example
```

## Benchmarks

```shell
./benchmarks/bench.sh    # vs Google.Protobuf C# generated code, four tiers
```

Needs `protoc` and NuGet access (`dotnet restore` fetches `Google.Protobuf`).
Numbers live in [BENCHMARKS.md](../../BENCHMARKS.md).

Strings cross as NUL-terminated C strings, so `Set(field, string)` stops at the
first NUL byte: use the `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` overload for binary payloads (a
`string` field accepts them too, which is how protobuf's wire format works).

## Ownership and threads

A `Schema` and a root `Message` own native memory: `Dispose()` frees it. A
`MessageType` keeps its `Schema` (and a `Message` its `MessageType`) reachable,
so the GC cannot free the schema under a live type or message; `Dispose()` is
still the caller's promise that nothing else uses it. A nested message is a view
of its parent, holds it alive through a `Parent` reference, and never frees
anything. Nothing is shared, so one tree belongs to one thread, like the C core.

## Typed models

`protoc-gen-pbwire-typed` (in `../typed`) generates sealed classes with typed
fields, `Encode(Schema)` and `static Decode`. The committed output is
`typed/gen/` for tests and `examples/gen/` for the example; `examples/Roundtrip.cs`
assigns typed fields only. See `../typed/README.md`.
